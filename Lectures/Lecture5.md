# Lecture 5: NODE.JS

## What is?

Server side tool for executing JS.

Wraps Googles V8 JS interpreter.

## Explaination

* Most is packaged in modules. http is one such package
* npm gives access to more (Node Package Manager)
* Functions are first-class objects.

## Event Loop
* "When x happens, do y"

## Execution Model
* Single threaded
  * Safe because each task is short and returns quickly
* IO happens in parallel
* Makes easy server side services
